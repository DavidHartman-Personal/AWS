# David Hartman - AWS Python Utilities
These are scripts, utilities, etc that I have created and/or found useful for performing tasks related to the creation, monitoring and support of AWS related services. I expect this repository will grow substantially over time. The various areas this repository covers are noted in the sections below. For items that are just place holders or heavily under construction the following legend can be referenced.

The following folders are included in this repository

* aws - This includes the classes defined to manage AWS related resource information (e.g. EC2 instances, etc).
* conf - This directory contains various configuration files that are used for controlling processes
* data - An output and input directory that will generally contain raw data in various formats (text, JSON,etc)
* get_inventory - These are scripts, etc that perform various processes to capture information about AWS resources
