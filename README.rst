David Hartman - AWS Python Utilities
====================================
These are scripts, utilities, etc that I have created and/or found useful for performing tasks related to the creation, monitoring and support of AWS related services.  I expect this repository will grow substantially over time.  The various areas this repository covers are noted in the sections below.  For items that are just place holders or heavily under construction the following legend can be referenced.
